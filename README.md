# Data Analysis on Employee Salaries and Demographicsüìä

This project performs data analysis on a dataset containing employee information such as salary, years of experience, job title, education level, gender, and country. The goal is to explore the relationships between various features like salary, experience, education level, and other demographic factors. Using **Pandas** for data cleaning and **Matplotlib** for visualization, we analyze several key questions related to employee salaries and demographics.
