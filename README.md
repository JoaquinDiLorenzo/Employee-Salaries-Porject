# Data Analysis on Employee Salaries and Demographics

## Overview

This project performs data analysis on a dataset containing employee information such as salary, years of experience, job title, education level, gender, and country. The goal is to explore the relationships between various features like salary, experience, education level, and other demographic factors. Using **Pandas** for data cleaning and **Matplotlib** for visualization, we analyze several key questions related to employee salaries and demographics.

## Key Questions Explored

The project addresses the following questions:

1. **What is the average salary across different countries?**
2. **What are the average years of experience for the top 5 most common job titles?**
3. **What is the distribution of education levels among employees?**
4. **What is the average salary by gender?**
5. **How does salary correlate with years of experience?**
6. **Do people with master’s degrees earn more than those with bachelor’s degrees?**
7. **Are there differences in education levels across countries?**

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting and executing the code in an interactive manner.
